1. Maintaining a stable and effective test automation suite in this dynamic environment -

    a. We can maintain a Page Object Model for UI tests to isolate page structure changes
    b. We can create Data builder patterns for flexible data objects
    c. We can create independent small test suites like smoke, sanity etc
    d. We can maintain a log file to capture all steps that are executed
    e. We can implement health checks that run automatically via CRON =
    f. We can also send alerts if a test case fails 5 or more time in last 10 runs

2.  Importance of testability and collaboration with developers -

    a. Collaboration with devs is important because it allows testers to understand, plan and prepare test cases for upcoming changes
    b. We can provide feedback to devs to add data test ids to be added during development
    c. We can ask devs to provide APIs that support controlled data, dry-run modes etc
    d. We can also share dashboards
    e. By implementing CI, we can expose failing tests to devs in pull requests

3. Handle versioning of test scripts, and test data -

    a. We can use GIT/Bitbucket to maintain our test scripts
    b. We can follow defined naming conventions for every branch that gets created
    c. We can add versions to every API that gets developed
    d. We can build test data dynamically by using builder patterns
    e. We can also store test data in data templates like /resources/test-data/1.4. This allows fallback to latest available test data if needed
    f. We can also categorize our test data based on environment like PROD/UAT/SIT
