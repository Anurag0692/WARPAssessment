1. How I would automate testing for complex UI elements -

    a. For Drag and Drop components, we can use Javascript to automate
        ((JavascriptExecutor) driver).executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);", element);
    b. We can use locators such as aria-expanded="true" in WebDriver wait so that selenium waits for these elements to load
    c. We can also use Actions class to simulate mouse actions such as hover, drag etc
    d. We can add code in app to expose internal state for Canvas elements and then compare them using Selenium

2. Handling synchronization issues and ensure reliable test execution -

    a. WebDriver wait gives us an option to explicitly wait for a page to load and the perform an activity
    b. If there are any global state flags, then we can use them to validate an element's visibility
    c. If there elements that cause synchronization issues, then we can use check points to verify them after every step

3.  Challenges of testing real-time data updates -

    a. This is a common scenario where the data updates before the test is ready to check which leads to a failure
    b. UI is loaded with a delay
    c. Actions class has be used
    d. Assert cannot be used

    Solution -

    a. WebDriver wait is a good option to dynamically wait for an element to load
    b. Instead of xpaths, we can use CSS selectors
